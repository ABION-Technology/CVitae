First version of CV MVC web application which will be on domain michaelgworkman.com

This MVC 5 web application has been implemented with database first Entity Framework,
but is different than a normal MVC web application in that it uses GUID for primary key ID in EF mdoels and database tables,
instead of an INT with IDENTITY. Also this MVC web application does not use bootstrap CSS, but uses W3Schools CSS styles instead,
available at https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/.

This MVC web application final destination will be the Microsoft Azure Cloud at domain michaelgworkman.com.

This application is freely distributable under terms of MIT open source license.
